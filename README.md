![Project Banner](docs/screenshots/banner.png)

A comprehensive internal support portal for iOS device troubleshooting in enterprise environments. This project reduces IT support tickets by automating common iOS issues and providing a searchable knowledge base.

Problem Statement

Employees at medium-sized companies struggle with recurring iOS/mobile device issues (email setup, MDM profiles, app crashes, connectivity). The IT support team spends excessive time on repetitive questions, and solutions are not documented consistently.

Solution

A dual-component system that:

1. Automates common iOS troubleshooting via Python scripts
2. Provides an internal web-based knowledge base where employees can search for solutions before contacting IT
